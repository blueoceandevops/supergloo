### TrafficSplit

 
TrafficTarget associates a set of traffic definitions (rules) with a service identity which is allocated to a group of pods.
Access is controlled via referenced TrafficSpecs and by a list of source service identities.
* If a pod which holds the referenced service identity makes a call to the destination on one of the defined routes then access
  will be allowed
* Any pod which attempts to connect and is not in the defined list of sources will be denied
* Any pod which is in the defined list, but attempts to connect on a route which is not in the list of the
  TrafficSpecs will be denied

### Quantity

 
Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number.
It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML,
in addition to String() and Int64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

<quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
  (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
<digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9
<digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits>
<number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits>
<sign>            ::= "+" | "-"
<signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number>
<suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI>
<binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
<decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
  (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
<decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent
a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal
places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up.
(E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix
it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a
corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
  1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a
floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed,
but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical
form, or don't diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without
writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will
cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

```yaml
"string": string

```
